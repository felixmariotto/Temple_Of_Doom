# the Temple of Doom
Runner game 2.5D with pixels and sprites

## Play online here : https://temple-of-doom.herokuapp.com  ##

This simple game is inspired from adventure works like Indiana Jones, the Mummy, Tomb Rider, Uncharted, Temple Run or Uncle Scrooge. (yes, never read The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, with the zombie ?).
It's almost a rule that when an adventurer take a treasure from a temple, a monster or something really bad immediately show up to destroy them/the wolrd.    
    
I've always liked this simple illustration of the "Greed is Vain" concept, and I've always thought it's a pitty that there is not more works inspired from this genre. So when it came for me to make a sample project of game using Three.js with SpriteMixer for sprite animations, I chose to make this.    
     
Have fun playing it !
